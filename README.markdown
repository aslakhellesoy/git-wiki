couchrest-wiki: because who needs cool names when you use CouchDB?
========================================================

couchrest-wiki is a fork of git-wiki that uses CouchDB to store data
instead of Git. Please see the git-wiki documentation for details.

I (Aslak Helles√∏y) ported git-wiki to CouchDB because I wanted to add meta tags 
and a tag cloud to the wiki. This seemed easier to do in a real database
than in Git, which doesn't provide any simple query or view capabilities
needed for this functionality.

## Install
